## Overview

The Cycles System in AtomixJs is designed to handle side effects within components in a manner similar to React's useEffect hook. It provides a structured approach to manage actions and cleanups throughout the component lifecycle.

### Regular Cycles

Regular cycles in AtomixJs resemble React's useEffect, focusing on handling side effects like setting up intervals or timeouts.

**Example: Regular Cycle with Interval**

```ts
class IntervalComponent extends Component {
  onStart() {
    this.cycle(() => {
      const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
        console.log("Interval tick");
      }, 1000);

      // Cleanup function for clearing the interval
      return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
    });
  }
}
```

In this example, `IntervalComponent` uses a regular cycle to set up an interval that logs a message every second. The cleanup function, which clears the interval, is similar to the cleanup function in React's useEffect.

### Named Cycles

Named cycles offer more control by allowing individual management of cycles. They are ideal for handling multiple, distinct side effects within the same component.

**Example: Named Cycle with Timeout**

```ts
class TimeoutComponent extends Component {
  onStart() {
    this.addEventListener("click", this.handleButtonClick);
  }

  handleButtonClick = () => {
    // Launch or reset the named cycle 'displayAction'
    this.namedCycle("displayAction", this.displayActionCycle);
  };

  displayActionCycle = () => {
    let timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Action displayed after 5 seconds");
    }, 5000);

    // Cleanup function to cancel the timeout
    return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
  };
}
```

In `TimeoutComponent`, each click initiates or resets the named cycle `displayAction`, setting a 5-second timeout. If clicked again within 5 seconds, the previous timeout is cancelled. This example shows how to manage delayed actions effectively.

### Conclusion

AtomixJs's Cycles System, akin to React's useEffect, offers a robust framework for handling side effects in components. Regular and named cycles provide flexible options for different use cases.
