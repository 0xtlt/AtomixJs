description: Understanding the Cycles System in AtomixJs Components.
---

The Cycles System in AtomixJs plays a crucial role in managing side effects within components, akin to lifecycle methods in traditional component-based frameworks. It enables the execution of code at specific points in a component's lifecycle, particularly during initialization and cleanup phases.

### Using Cycles in Components

#### The Cycle Method

In AtomixJs, the `cycle` method is an integral part of a component's lifecycle management. It allows developers to define functions that are executed during different lifecycle stages of a component. These functions can optionally return a cleanup function, which is invoked when the component is being destroyed, ensuring efficient resource management.

#### Clearing Cycles

AtomixJs also includes functionality to clear all cycles associated with a component. This is vital for preventing memory leaks and ensuring that no residual effects persist after a component has been removed.

### Example Usage

Here's an example that demonstrates the use of a cycle in a component with `setInterval`:

```ts
class MyComponent extends Component {
  start() {
    this.cycle(() => {
      const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
        console.log("Interval tick");
      }, 1000);

      return () => {
        clearInterval(intervalId);
        console.log("Interval cleared on component destruction");
      };
    });
  }
}
```
