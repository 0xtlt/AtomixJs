AtomixJs components are like react components with lifecycle methods. They are used to create reusable UI elements and they are lightweight (_less than 1kb_).

## Creating a component

We can create a component by extending the `Component` class and implementing the `start` method.\
This method is called when the component is mounted during the first render in the Component's lifecycle.

```ts
import { Component } from "atomixjs";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  start() {
    console.log("start");
  }
}
```

## Framework auto-attach

### WebComponent decorator

A component can be attached to a web component by using the `WebComponent` decorator.

```ts
import { Component, WebComponent } from "atomixjs";

@WebComponent("atomix-component")
class MyComponent extends Component {
  start() {
    console.log("start");
  }
}
```

```html
<atomix-component>...</atomix-component>
```

### Lazyload the component

You can lazyload the component by using the `lazyload = true` option in your Component.\
`start` method will be called when the component is visible on the screen.

```ts
import { Component, WebComponent } from "atomixjs";

@WebComponent("atomix-component")
class MyComponent extends Component {
  lazyload = true;

  start() {
    console.log("start");
  }
}
```

:::caution
`constructor` and outer states are not lazyloaded.\
Do not overide the `connectedCallback` and `disconnectedCallback` methods, they are internally used by the framework.
:::

```html
<atomix-component>...</atomix-component>
```

:::danger
This component should never be used if your component needs to be attached to a web component that is not on the screen.
