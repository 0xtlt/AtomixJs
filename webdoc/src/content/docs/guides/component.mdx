AtomixJs components are like react components with lifecycle methods. They are used to create reusable UI elements and they are lightweight (_less than 1kb_).

## Creating a component

We can create a component by extending the `Component` class and implementing the `start` method.\
This method is called when the component is mounted during the first render in the Component's lifecycle.

```ts
import { Component } from "atomixjs";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  start() {
    console.log("start");
  }
}
```

## Attaching a component to a web component

We can attach a component to a web component by using the `attach` method.

```html
<div id="component">...</div>
```

```ts
MyComponent.attach("#component");
```

## Framework auto-attach

### WebComponent decorator

A component can be attached to a web component by using the `WebComponent` decorator.

```ts
import { Component, WebComponent } from "atomixjs";

@WebComponent("atomix-component")
class MyComponent extends Component {
  start() {
    console.log("start");
  }
}
```

```html
<atomix-component>...</atomix-component>
```

### WebLazyComponent decorator

A component can be attached to a web component by using the `WebLazyComponent` decorator.\
This decorator is used to defer the component's initialization until the web component is on the screen.\
This is useful for intensive computations components like sliders, 3D models, etc.

```ts
import { Component, WebLazyComponent } from "atomixjs";

@WebLazyComponent("atomix-component")
class MyComponent extends Component {
  start() {
    console.log("start");
  }
}
```

```html
<atomix-component>...</atomix-component>
```

:::danger
This component should never be used if your component needs to be attached to a web component that is not on the screen.
